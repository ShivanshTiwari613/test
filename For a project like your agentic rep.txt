For a project like your agentic report maker, the key is to balance efficiency, robustness, and maintainability. Here are some recommendations:

Modular Scraping Approach:
• Static vs. Dynamic Content:
  – For academic sites that serve most of their content as static HTML (like many institutional pages or repositories), using Python’s Requests library combined with Beautiful Soup is typically fast and resource-efficient.
  – For sites that render content dynamically (e.g., Google Scholar or pages that require JavaScript execution), consider using a headless browser solution such as Selenium (or alternatives like Puppeteer/Pyppeteer) to ensure you capture the fully rendered content.
Asynchronous or Scalable Frameworks:
• If you need to scrape many pages concurrently (for each report section like Introduction, Literature Review, etc.), frameworks such as Scrapy or asynchronous libraries (like aiohttp) can help manage multiple requests simultaneously, which improves overall speed and efficiency.
Anti-Bot and Reliability Measures:
• Many academic sites implement anti-scraping measures. Incorporating proxy rotation, appropriate HTTP headers (e.g., a valid User-Agent), and possibly a specialized scraping API (such as ZenRows or Scrapingdog) can make your scraper more resilient.
Integration with Gemini and Post-Processing:
• Since your project generates queries via the Gemini API, design your scraping module to accept a URL or query result and then dynamically choose the best scraping method (Requests/Beautiful Soup for static pages; Selenium for dynamic ones).
• Once you’ve collected raw data—including text, tables, and statistical data—the next stage uses your deepseek LLM to reformat and add an empathetic, human-like tone before converting to PDF. Keeping the scraping and formatting processes decoupled improves maintainability.
Maintainability and Flexibility:
• Use robust selectors (e.g., CSS selectors or XPath with fallback strategies) to make your scraping code less prone to breakage when pages change.
• Logging and error-handling mechanisms will help you catch changes early and adjust as needed.
In summary:
For your agent, a hybrid approach is best—start with lightweight, direct HTTP requests and Beautiful Soup for most academic pages, and incorporate Selenium (or an equivalent headless browser) for those that require JavaScript rendering. Additionally, consider an asynchronous or framework-based solution like Scrapy if scalability becomes an issue. This combination will provide a resourceful, correct, and efficient scraping pipeline to feed your report-making agent.

This modular and adaptive design should serve your dual-process system well, ensuring both high-quality data extraction and sophisticated report formatting.
